railo-maven-template
====================

Quickly use the railo coldfusion app server from within your maven webapp, with Jetty

##Usage

From the project root, just run this command:

    mvn jetty:run

Once everything downloads and runs, you'll have a CF webserver running on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).  The document root being served is src/main/webapp.
